# CPTInfo #

**CPTInfo** is a Win32/Linux C console application which aim is to become GIMP plugin allowing import of Corel PHOTO-PAINT's layered format CPT images (CPT format concept is similar to Adobe's PSD or GIMP XCF).

There is also basic CPT file format specification provided (mostly incomplete at the moment).

At the moment, CPTInfo, as name suggests, allows only to display and dump some information from .cpt files created in Corel PHOTO-PAINT versions 7.0 to X4.

To compile source on Linux You will need GNU GCC, [GLib](http://www.gtk.org/) library as well as [pkg-config](http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/). On Win32, you may use [Dev-C++ IDE](http://bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html).
