0.039 - put on Google Code Hosting, fixed minor bug, LGPL license
0.038 - separate error messages for corrupt and not CPT file
0.037 - added (naive) creator application version detection.
0.036 - changed version detection code and flag handling, now more CPT-like
0.035 - 'oinf' partial decoding, small bugfixes
0.034 - fixed bug with incorrectly displaying '[!]' in normal output mode for
        .cpt files created by CPT9. Decoding chunks: 'pthw' (full), 'bnam'
        (full), 'bnwm' (full), 'path' (partial).
0.033 - 'grid' decoding improved: grid values.
0.032 - start of chunk processing. Partial 'grid' decoding: measure unit.
        Use -v in normal mode to display.
0.031 - replaced almost all printf()s with ci_msg() at appropriate level. Code
        simplified a bit; new option -sh, -s output improved a bit.
0.030 - fixed memory violation bugs when performing additional checks.
0.029 - print first uint32_t value at given data offset; data offset table now
        iterated in more proper (hope so) way
0.028 - object embedded palette detection (very experimental). -v option now
        outputs chunk names and data offset table in -s mode, minor fixes
0.027 - minor fixes and changes, make -od option work without -oc (however,
        chunk search / testing is performed anyway)
0.026 - too tired to document... zZzZ
0.025 - more intelligent chunk search, some checks based on guesses, more info
        on output...
0.024 - short output of block & chunk information with -s mode; spaces within
        filename in -s mode are replaced with '_' char for easier script parsing;
0.023 - Win32 version, console output locale fixes, langinfo.h dependancy removed.
0.022 - option -oc works now, help text update, minor display bug fixed
0.021 - option -ob removed, new -br <n|n-m> option (allows to specify block range),
        block information output, -v option for more verbosity
0.020 - -db option implemented, dumping to directory in . with name basename.blocks
0.019 - calculation of addresses now hopefully correct, implemented
        recognition of internal ICC type used
0.018 - palette and ICC profile dumping implemented, -op option removed in
        favour of -dp and hexdump
0.017 - set max size of comment strings (bot a&w versions)
0.016 - option -c <charset> added; fixed bug appearing when g_convert() fails
0.015 - fixed possible bug with realloc() with help of Valgrind, wide
        comment now printed
0.014 - change iconv.h stuff to glib.h functions, show ANSI comment,
        show ICC profile information if present
0.013 - show if there's embedded comment and/or ICC profile
0.012 - fixed bug with ydpi calculation, fixed bug with color number,
        color number output by default
0.011 - program code rewrite, changed naming convention in cpt.h,
        split cpt.h into cpt.h + cpt6.h; short mode output changed, verbose
        mode output changed, program arguments more fluid, faster parsing,
        more erroronous and unusual situations detected, handle CPT7 files
        created by PP9, some functionality still missing though.
0.010 - tabelarized color models, chunk dword dump
0.009 - -df option, chunks search disabled by default
0.008 - fixed bug with color table not dumping when colors==256
0.007 - new option -sp, show resolutions of both CPT7 and CPT9
0.006 - cpt.h: image header struct, display some iheader info
0.005 - complete rewrite of code, cpt.h file created, CPT 6.0 detection
0.004 - command line options changed, fixed damn strncat bug, atexit func
0.003 - base version
